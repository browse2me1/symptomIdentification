    <h2>ℹ️ About the Symptom-Based Disease Identification System</h2>

    <p>
        The Symptom-Based Disease Identification System is a public health tool designed to raise awareness and aid individuals in identifying potential diseases based on the symptoms they experience.
        This system is particularly beneficial in areas with limited access to immediate medical consultation, allowing users to gain preliminary information about their health condition.
    </p>

    <p>
        The system does not provide a diagnosis but serves as a knowledge tool. Users are encouraged to consult medical professionals for confirmation and treatment. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Its goal is to promote health literacy, enhance disease awareness, and support early health-seeking behavior by offering preventive advice and guiding users toward proper medical attention. Developed as a final <i>© 2025 –  Year Project</i> for graduation.Developed by:<b>Anmut Tsegaye<b> and group members.
